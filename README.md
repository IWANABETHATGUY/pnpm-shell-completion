## Features

- Provide completion for `pnpm --filter <package>`.
- Provide completion for `pnpm remove` command, even in workspace's packages (by specifying `--filter` option).
- Provide completion for npm scripts in `package.json`.

Note that we won't provide completion for all commands and options,
and we only focus those frequently used.
Too many completion items may have impact on efficiency.
